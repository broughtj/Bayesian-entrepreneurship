> This is the eternal source of art : a man is faced by a form which desires to be made through him into a work. This form is no offspring of his soul, but is an appearance which steps up to it and demands of it the effective power. The man is concerned with an act of his being. If he carries it -through, if he speaks the primary word out of his being to the form which appears, then the effective power streams out, and the work arises.
