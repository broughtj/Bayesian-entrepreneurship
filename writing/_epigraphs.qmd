> *The Austrians have played an important role in keeping a set of ideas alive in the face of a sometimes hostile mainstream. Any progress forward, however, need not, indeed should not, be a further continuance of an isolated "Austrian" economics.... In fact, it seems indisputable that scientific understanding would be much improved if at some point in the future we could genuinely and intelligently say, along with Milton Friedman, there is no such thing as Austrian economics, only good economics and bad economics. But this time we would mean that good economics was an economics not only of preferences and constraints, but also an economics of time and ignorance.* -- @Vaughn1994
